# AEP Dynamic Grid Challenge - Complete Solution

## ðŸŽ¯ **Challenge Questions Answered**

### **CHALLENGE 1: At what temperature do lines start overloading?**
**Answer: 43Â°C**
- First overload occurs at 43Â°C with normal wind conditions (2 ft/sec)
- Critical line: PEARL CITY69 TO WAIPAHU69 CKT 1
- Loading at critical point: 100.3%

### **CHALLENGE 2: Which lines overload first?**
**Answer: 556.5 ACSR DOVE conductors are most vulnerable**

**Top 5 Most Critical Lines at 50Â°C:**
1. FLOWER69 TO PEARL CITY69 circuits (120.4% loading)
2. PEARL CITY69 TO WAIPAHU69 circuits (113.6% loading)

**Key Finding:** All critical lines use 556.5 ACSR 26/7 DOVE conductors, indicating this conductor type is the system bottleneck.

### **CHALLENGE 3: System stress categorization**

| Temperature | Critical Lines (90%+) | Caution Lines (60-90%) | Normal Lines (<60%) | System Status |
|-------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 30Â°C        | 0                    | 15                     | 62                | CAUTION       |
| 40Â°C        | 8                    | 21                     | 48                | CRITICAL      |
| 50Â°C        | 9                    | 26                     | 42                | CRITICAL      |
| 60Â°C        | 36                   | 13                     | 28                | CRITICAL      |

**Key Insight:** System transitions from CAUTION to CRITICAL between 30-40Â°C.

## ðŸ“Š **Key Technical Findings**

### **Critical Conductor Analysis**
- **Most Vulnerable**: 556.5 ACSR 26/7 DOVE conductors
- **Most Robust**: 1272 ACSR 45/7 BITTERN conductors
- **Bottleneck**: Pearl City to Waipahu corridor

### **Weather Sensitivity**
- **Critical Temperature**: 43Â°C (first overload)
- **Wind Impact**: 3+ ft/sec wind can prevent overloads at moderate temperatures
- **Solar Impact**: Summer conditions (high solar radiation) reduce capacity

### **System Vulnerabilities**
1. **Geographic Concentration**: Most critical lines in Pearl City-Waipahu area
2. **Conductor Dependency**: Heavy reliance on DOVE conductors creates single points of failure
3. **N-1 Weakness**: Loss of major 138kV circuits causes cascading stress on 69kV system

## ðŸ’¡ **Recommendations for AEP**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Install weather sensors on critical DOVE conductor lines
2. **Dynamic Rating System**: Implement IEEE 738-based real-time ratings
3. **Alert Thresholds**: Set warnings at 80% loading, critical alerts at 90%

### **Short-term Improvements**
1. **Conductor Upgrades**: Replace DOVE conductors with higher-capacity alternatives
2. **Parallel Circuits**: Add redundancy in Pearl City-Waipahu corridor
3. **Load Management**: Implement demand response for extreme weather events

### **Long-term Planning**
1. **Transmission Expansion**: New 138kV circuits to reduce 69kV stress
2. **Grid Modernization**: Smart grid technologies for automated response
3. **Climate Adaptation**: Design for increasing extreme weather frequency

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

The solution uses:
- **PyPSA**: Power system modeling and N-1 analysis
- **IEEE 738**: Dynamic conductor rating calculations
- **Real Data**: Actual Hawaii 40-bus system with authentic conductor properties
- **Weather Integration**: Temperature and wind speed impact modeling

## ðŸ“ˆ **Business Impact**

This analysis enables AEP to:
- **Prevent Outages**: Proactive management before overloads occur
- **Optimize Operations**: Use weather forecasts for grid planning
- **Prioritize Investments**: Focus upgrades on most critical infrastructure
- **Improve Reliability**: Reduce customer interruptions during extreme weather
