# AEP Grid Challenge - Refactored Structure

The application has been refactored from a single 750+ line file into a modular structure for better maintainability.

## New File Structure

### Core Application Files

- **`main.py`** (25 lines) - Main Flask application entry point and route definitions
- **`run_app.py`** (12 lines) - Application runner with startup messages
- **`config.py`** (20 lines) - Configuration constants and settings
- **`utils.py`** (75 lines) - Utility functions and global data management

### Feature Modules

- **`grid_analyzer.py`** (150+ lines) - FlaskGridAnalyzer class and grid analysis logic
- **`api_routes.py`** (120+ lines) - All API route handlers
- **`ai_service.py`** (130+ lines) - AI summary and recommendation functionality

### Legacy Compatibility

- **`enhanced_app.py`** (25 lines) - Legacy entry point that imports from new structure
- **`enhanced_app_backup.py`** (10 lines) - Reference to original implementation

## How to Run

### New Way (Recommended)
```bash
python main.py
# or
python run_app.py
```

### Legacy Way (Still Works)
```bash
python enhanced_app.py
```

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Maintainability**: Each file has a single responsibility
2. **Readability**: No more 750-line files to navigate
3. **Modularity**: Easy to modify individual components
4. **Testing**: Easier to unit test individual modules
5. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different modules
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing scripts still work

## File Responsibilities

- **main.py**: Flask app initialization, main routes (`/`, `/n1`)
- **grid_analyzer.py**: All grid analysis logic, N-1 contingency analysis
- **api_routes.py**: API endpoints (`/api/*`)
- **ai_service.py**: AI summary generation and prompt creation
- **utils.py**: Global data management, utility functions
- **config.py**: Constants, API keys, configuration

## No Functionality Changes

⚠️ **Important**: This refactoring does NOT change any functionality. All features work exactly the same as before. Only the code organization has been improved.

## Templates and Static Files

The `templates/` directory and all HTML files remain unchanged. The refactoring only affects the Python backend code structure.
